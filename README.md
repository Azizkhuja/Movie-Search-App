# Movie-Search-App
[Demo Link](https://movie-infos-search.netlify.app/)
### In this application I have used `React.js`, `Vite.js`, `axios`, `OMDb API` and Pure `CSS`(without any 3rd party frameworks). 
##### `React.js`, `Vite.js` make development process more smooth and fast(Insted of WebPack) and `axios` makes asynchronously fetching data from OMDb API(https://www.omdbapi.com/)
